# What is UNODisaaster?

The Disaster Researchers in the College of Information Science and Technology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha are primarily concerned with engaging emergency management (EM) practice in FEMA Region 7 (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska) to understand where technology could augment existing practice in order to enhance EM's ability to save lives. This work is primarily being done under 3 specific headings: 

1. [Crisis Informatics (What could be possible)](#CI-What)
2. [Science and Technology Integration (What is needed)](#STISIG)
3. [Training Development (How to integrate)](#Training)

Through these 3 premises, the work undertaken by this group of researchers, students, co-investigators, and practitioners tends to fall into numerous domains and disciplines including: 

* Sociology
* Information Science
* Human-Computer Interaction
* Anthropology
* Communication Studies
* Disaster Science
* Game Studies

What we seek to do is to unpack decades of practice; find what can be done immediately, in the near future, and in the distant future; and begin to re-pack practice with technological knowledge that has been developing outside of EM practice for a number of years. This re-packing will be done with training modules, insider knowledge as a practitioner, and tabletop exercises. 

It is important to note that we are not concerned with the bleeding edge of technology, but with minimal, stable, and robust technologies that can enhance existing procedures without adding overhead, specialized skills, or the need to hire IT professionals. This is important to note because we seek to translate computer science, information science, and other technical domains in such a way as to render their inner workings known, understandable, and configurable without effort. And so when we say, "augment" we mean to "augment" not replace, upgrade, or otherwise overwhelm. 

The place of EM in the zeitgeist, especially that of COVID, is as such that in the midst of disaster, it is sought after. Between disasters almost all interest disappears and while we are currently in an upward spring of natural hazards, we are not in an upward swing of protecting human-life from them. As such, we approach the practice of emergency management as though EM are moslty responsible for trying to save us from ourselves without money, resources, or technology.

## Crisis Informatics or What Could be Possible

The driving force for this work is through the domain of crisis informatics. It is a driving force because for over 15 years, the work done in and around the term, "[crisis informatics](https://tinyurl.com/crisisinformatics)" has failed to take hold in the spaces in and around Emergency Management. 

Crisis Informatics is primarily `“Concerned with the ways in which information systems are entangled with socio-behavioral phenomena connected to disasters, [the field of] crisis informatics offers a rich set of research methods and empirical opportunities for examining the consequences of the role of technology in mediating our relations with the world.” (Soden and Palen 2018)`

Ye, this is not what Crisis Informatics is. To be more direct, crisis informatics `“addresses sociotechnical concerns in large-scale emergency response. Additionally it expands consideration to include not only official responders (who tend to be the focus in policy and technology-focused matters), but also members of the public. It therefore views emergency response as a social system where information is disseminated within and between official and public channels and entities. Crisis informatics wrestles with methodological concerns as it strives to develop new theory and support informed development of ICT and policy.” (Palen, Anderson, Mark, Martin, Sicker, Palmer, Grunwald, 2009)`

So there are empirical possibilities with the domain of internet-communication technologies broadly; however, many of those possibilities cannot be realized without engaging an increasingly important deficit within the EM realm. That deficit begins with the fact that practice has never required a computer. It continues through the "sameness" of all EM in the form of the [Incident Command System (ICS)](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=is-100.c) and the homogeneity of EM more generally. And it is all excacerbated by attempts to insert technology into practice without stakeholder engagement or basic ethnographic understanding of practice. 

As a result, all of these concerns, opportunities, methods, and consequences remain unanswered, unnoticed, and are without consequence for emergency management itself.

Yet, there is a need for this type of engagement in EM. The need grows daily as the average consumer moves away from telephone calls to messaging apps, from television to streaming media, in conjunction with the growing threat provided by information communication technologies which was developed quickly and has created new types of vulnerabilities.

## Science and Technology Integration or What Could be Integrated with EM Practice+

In order to better understand where and what could be integrated, there is a need to understand Emergency Management as it is currently practiced. To do this...

## Training Development or How to Integrate Technology with EM

EM does not currently have a path to professionalization. While there are some degree programs out there, the bulk of EM practitioners come from the armed forces, from emergency services, and other similar domains. As a result, any sort of shift in practice will need to occur not inside of college programs (though this will happen over time), but in places where practice is learned. Through training modules at places like the [Emergency Management Institute](https://training.fema.gov/emi.aspx), the [International Association of Emergency Management](https://www.iaem.org/), and the [National Emergency Management Association](https://www.nemaweb.org/).

In addition, training exercises [(outlined on Ready.gov)](https://www.ready.gov/exercises) can help bring existing practitioners on board as they learn about the theory of computational techniques while not actually being tasked to perform them. 

All of this requires work in and around that of Tabletop Role-Playing Games, Video Games, and everything in between in order to better understand a number of aspects related to tabletop exercises. This includes: 

* Immersion
* Knowledge Transfer
* How systems mediate action
* How mixed media can be done cheaply and effectively
