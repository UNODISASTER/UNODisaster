# What is UNODisaaster?

The Disaster Researchers in the College of Information Science and Technology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha are primarily concerned with engaging emergency management (EM) practice in FEMA Region 7 (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska) to understand where technology could augment existing practices in order to enhance EM's ability to save lives. This work is primarily being done under 3 specific headings: 

1. Crisis Informatics (What could be possible)
2. Science and Technology Integration (What is needed)
3. Training Development (How to integrate)



# Origin Point

For over 15 years, the work done in and around the term, "[crisis informatics](https://tinyurl.com/crisisinformatics)" has failed to take hold in the spaces in and around Emergency Management. Crisis Informatics is: 

`“Concerned with the ways in which information systems are entangled with socio-behavioral phenomena connected to disasters, [the field of] crisis informatics offers a rich set of research methods and empirical opportunities for examining the consequences of the role of technology in mediating our relations with the world.” (Soden and Palen 2018)`

More specifically, crisis informatics:

`“addresses sociotechnical concerns in large-scale emergency response. Additionally it expands consideration to include not only official responders (who tend to be the focus in policy and technology-focused matters), but also members of the public. It therefore views emergency response as a social system where information is disseminated within and between official and public channels and entities. Crisis informatics wrestles with methodological concerns as it strives to develop new theory and support informed development of ICT and policy.” (Palen, Anderson, Mark, Martin, Sicker, Palmer, Grunwald, 2009)`

Yet, all of these concerns, opportunities, methods, and consequences remain unanswer, unnoticed, and are without consequence for emergency management itself.
